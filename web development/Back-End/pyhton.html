<h3>Python Programming Language</h3>
<img src="python logo.png" alt="image not found" height="500" width="500">
<p>Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.

    Python is widely used language
    Python is used for:
    
    Web Development: Frameworks like Django, Flask.
    Data Science and Analysis: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
    Machine Learning and AI: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
    Automation and Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks.
    Game Development: Libraries like Pygame.
    Web Scraping: Tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
    Desktop Applications: GUI frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt.
    Scientific Computing: SciPy, SymPy.
    Internet of Things (IoT): MicroPython, Raspberry Pi.
    DevOps and Cloud: Automation scripts and APIs.
    Cybersecurity: Penetration testing and ethical hacking tools.
    Key Features of Python
    Python is Easy to Learn and Use: There is no prerequisite to start Python, since it is Ideal programming language for beginners.
    High Level Language: Python don’t let you worry about low-level details, like memory management, hardware-level operations etc.
    Python is Interpreted: Code is executed line-by-line directly by interpreter, and no need for separate compilation. Which means –
    
    You can run the same code across different platforms.
    You can make the changes in code without restarting the program.
    Dynamic Typed: Python is a dynamic language, meaning there are no need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Type is checked during runtime, not at compile time.
    Object Oriented: Python supports object-oriented concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism etc. OOPs empowers Python with modularity, reusability and easy to maintain code.
    Extensive Library are Available: Python has huge set of library and modules, which can make development lot easier and faster.
    Open-Source with Huge community Support: Along with opensource, Python is blessed with very large community contributing to its further development.
    Cross Platform: Same Python code can run on Windows, macOS and Linux, without any modification in code.
    Good Career Opportunities: Python is in high demand across industries like Software development, AI, finance, and cloud computing etc.Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted programming language.
