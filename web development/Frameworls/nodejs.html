<p>Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine.

    It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications.
    JavaScript was earlier mainly used for frontend development. With Node JS (Introduced in 2009), JavaScript became a backend language as well.
    Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance.
    Supports the creation of REST APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
    Comes with a rich library of modules through npm (Node Package Manager)
