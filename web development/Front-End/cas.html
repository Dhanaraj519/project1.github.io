<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

    It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
    The main advantages are separation of content (in HTML) and styling (in CSS) and the same CSS rules can be used across all pages and not have to be rewritten.
    HTML uses tags and CSS uses rule sets.
    CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.
    Why CSS?
    Saves Time: Write CSS once and reuse it across multiple HTML pages.
    Easy Maintenance: Change the style globally with a single modification.
    Search Engine Friendly: Clean coding technique that improves readability for search engines.
    Superior Styles: Offers a wider array of attributes compared to HTML.
    Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally using offline cache, allowing offline viewing.
    CSS Syntax
    CSS consists of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and applied to the corresponding elements. A style rule set includes a selector and a declaration block.
    
    Selector: Targets specific HTML elements to apply styles.
    Declaration: Combination of a property and its corresponding value.</p>
