    JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.
    
    JavaScript is a single-threaded language which means it executes one task at a time.
    It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
    The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript that’s why it is called dynamically typed.
    Key Features of JavaScript
    Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript runs on the user’s browser, so has a faster response time without needing to communicate with the server.
    Versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex server-side applications.
    Event-Driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, keystrokes) in real-time.
    Asynchronous: JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface.
    Rich Ecosystem: There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which make development faster and more efficient.
